[django-flat-theme] is a https://github.com/elky/django-flat-theme a drop-in theme for the Django admin interface, making it look more modern and clean.

Just install, add 'flat' to `INSTALLED_APPS` (before 'django.contrib.admin'), done. It's not invasive:

> This app just overrides default admin's CSS. All changes are about colors, margins, sizes. Nothing major. There are no markup changes.

Even if it's not a major overhaul, it's nice if things just *change* every once in a while.
