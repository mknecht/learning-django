title: Django Security Interview Questions

Want to get a feel for your knowledge of Django security?

Levi Gross collected [a bunch of questions](http://www.levigross.com/2014/02/07/django-security-interview-questions/) related to security. These provide a good starting point to read up. Kevin London then [took a stab at them]( http://kevinlondon.com/2015/10/16/answers-to-django-security-questions.html), and came up with answers / opinions / resources.

Do skim thru Kevins post, so that alarm bells start ringing, when you see a mismanaged project.
