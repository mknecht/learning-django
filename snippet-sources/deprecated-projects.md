Projects that I stumbled upon, that were not worth it,
for example cuz they're ancient.
Really more a list at what *not* to look at.

# django-lint

[Project page](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/django-lint), [GitHub page](https://github.com/lamby/django-lint)

Nice idea, but completely outdated. Last commit was several years ago, it's not on pypi, though pip installable.
Could not make it work (some ImportError, guess my PyLint version was too high).
